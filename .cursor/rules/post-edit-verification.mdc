# Post-Edit Verification

After editing any `.svelte` or `.ts` file in `src/`:

1. Run `npm run check` (svelte-check + svelte-kit sync)
2. Run `npm run lint` (prettier + eslint)
3. Run `npm run knip`
4. Fix any reported issues — do not consider the task complete until all pass

For Svelte components: also run `svelte-autofixer` and iterate until no issues remain (see svelte-code-quality rule).
